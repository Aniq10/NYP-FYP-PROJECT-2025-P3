This was my favorite book of 2023! Demons (affiliate link) is a gripping, chilling, tragic, and thought-provoking story. (Note: this book contains mature themes.)

If you’ve read and enjoyed Dostoevsky’s other more famous novels (The Brothers Karamazov and Crime and Punishment), then I definitely recommend reading this one too.

I want to write a more in-depth post about it (or I might make a video). But suffice to say that Dostoevsky was inspired to write the book by a political murder that horrified Russia in 1869.

The edition I read (translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky) is over 700 pages, and the murder does not happen until very late in the story. But Dostoevsky strings the reader along with puzzling events that the narrator cannot explain because all of the characters are keeping secrets from each other.

However, the narrator promises that all will become clear later on. He entices the reader to keep reading with paragraphs like this one from part one, chapter seven:

The ‘next day’— that is, the same Sunday on which Stepan Trofimovich’s fate was to be irrevocably decided—was one of the most portentous days in my chronicle. It was a day of the unexpected, a day of the unraveling of the old and the raveling up of the new, a day of sharp explanations and of a still greater muddle. In the morning, as the reader already knows, I was obliged to accompany my friend to Varvara Petrovna’s, at her own stipulation, and by three in the afternoon I had to be at Lizaveta Nikolaevna’s, in order to tell her—about what I did not know, and to assist her—in what I did not know. And yet it all resolved itself in a way no one could have imagined. In short, it was a day of surprisingly converging accidents.
